### ðŸ“‚ Database Schema

#### *1. orders Table*
Stores details of orders placed.

sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    order_time TIME NOT NULL
);


#### *2. order_details Table*
Stores details of individual pizzas ordered.

sql
CREATE TABLE order_details (
    order_details_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    pizza_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL
);

## ðŸ›  SQL Queries

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Queries

#### *1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed*
sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders FROM orders;


#### *2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales*
sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price), 0) AS total_revenue
FROM order_details 
JOIN pizzas ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id;


#### *3. Identify the highest-priced pizza*
sql
SELECT pizza_types.name, MAX(pizzas.price) AS highest_priced_pizza
FROM pizza_types 
JOIN pizzas ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
GROUP BY pizza_types.name 
ORDER BY highest_priced_pizza DESC 
LIMIT 1;


#### *4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered*
sql
SELECT pizzas.size, COUNT(order_details.order_details_id) AS most_common_pizza_size_ordered
FROM pizzas 
JOIN order_details ON pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizzas.size
ORDER BY most_common_pizza_size_ordered DESC 
LIMIT 1;


#### *5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities*
sql
SELECT pizza_types.name, SUM(order_details.quantity) AS most_ordered_pizza
FROM pizza_types 
JOIN pizzas ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
JOIN order_details ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_types.name
ORDER BY most_ordered_pizza DESC 
LIMIT 5;


---

### ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Queries

#### *1. Find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered*
sql
SELECT pizza_types.category, SUM(order_details.quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM pizza_types 
JOIN pizzas ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
JOIN order_details ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_types.category;


#### *2. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day*
sql
SELECT HOUR(orders.order_time) AS order_hour, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders 
GROUP BY HOUR(orders.order_time);


#### *3. Find the category-wise distribution of pizzas*
sql
SELECT category, COUNT(name) AS pizza_count
FROM pizza_types
GROUP BY category;


#### *4. Calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day*
sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(quantity), 0) AS avg_pizzas_per_day
FROM (
    SELECT orders.order_date, SUM(order_details.quantity) AS quantity
    FROM orders 
    JOIN order_details ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
    GROUP BY orders.order_date
) AS order_quantity;


#### *5. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue*
sql
SELECT pizza_types.name, ROUND(SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price), 0) AS total_revenue
FROM pizza_types 
JOIN pizzas ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
JOIN order_details ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_types.name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC 
LIMIT 3;


---

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Queries

#### *1. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue*
sql
SELECT pizza_types.name,
    ROUND(SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) / 
    (SELECT ROUND(SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price), 2)
     FROM order_details 
     JOIN pizzas ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id) * 100, 2) AS revenue_percentage
FROM pizza_types 
JOIN pizzas ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
JOIN order_details ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_types.name;


#### *2. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time*
sql
SELECT order_date,
       SUM(total_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS cumulative_revenue
FROM (
    SELECT orders.order_date, ROUND(SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price), 0) AS total_revenue
    FROM order_details 
    JOIN pizzas ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
    JOIN orders ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
    GROUP BY orders.order_date
) AS total_sales;


#### *3. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category*
sql
WITH ranked_pizza_types AS (
    SELECT pizza_types.name, pizza_types.category,
           SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) AS total_revenue,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY pizza_types.category ORDER BY SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM order_details 
    JOIN pizzas ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
    JOIN pizza_types ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
    GROUP BY pizza_types.name, pizza_types.category
)
SELECT name, category, total_revenue, rnk
FROM ranked_pizza_types
WHERE rnk <= 3;
